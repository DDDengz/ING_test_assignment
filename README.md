- used snapkit (all constraints are programatic -> no storyboards or xibs -> better for testing and for maintenance)
- implemented Unit Tests
- avoided Massive View Controllers
- implemented Apple Watch/Today widget but without scroll (Avoid putting a scroll view inside a Today widget. Itâ€™s difficult for users to scroll within a widget without inadvertently scrolling the Today view: https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/General/Conceptual/ExtensibilityPG/Today.html)
